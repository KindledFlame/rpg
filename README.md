Hello!

Most of the game is explained in game, but one common mistake is that when you battle, eat or drink, you don't do:

    >>battle goblin
 
You must do

    >>battle 
    (hit enter)
        >>goblin
    (hit enter)
    
(fight happens)

Same goes for eating and drinking

Thank you for playing my game!
